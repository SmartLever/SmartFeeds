# SmartFeed #

**SmartFeeds** is an innovative Python tool that filters out noise from the vast amount of daily social media posts, 
helping users save time. It uses OpenAI algorithms to analyze and identify the most discussed social media narratives, 
providing a concise summary that highlights key ideas and topics of interest.

In its default and first version, SmartFeeds follows the main traders and storytellers in the cryptocurrency space on Twitter. 
However, this can be customized to follow any topic and social media platform.‚Äù

The application will provide a daily summary of the stories that have received the most attention on a 
social platform and send it to a Telegram channel.

The idea was initially established with the intention of utilizing technology to enhance the social media experience,
rather of wasting countless hours reading every message in an **dopamine infinitive feed**. 
Tools like "**SmartFeeds**" will become more and more crucial for people and organizations trying to keep current 
with the latest trends and advances without being a slave to another algorithm as the use of social media continues 
to expand and improve.
